# Problem 21
# ==========
#    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
#    n which divide evenly into n).
#    If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair
#    and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

#    For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22,
#    44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,
#    2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

#    Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
